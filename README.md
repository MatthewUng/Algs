# Algs

Learning to complete the last layer of CFOP with fast/efficient algorithms has always been the most time-consuming aspect of speed.  Algs presents possible OLL and PLL algorithms after given the appropriate pattern, accounting for both rotations and color permutations.  The program allows users the ability to concentrate exclusively on decreasing solve times by removing the need to constantly comparing cube diagrams and searching for specific algorithms.

Algorithms have been taken from algdb.net
